# Automate CI/CD resources management
---
# Problem
Developers are manully creating the CI/CD resources.
- Deployment buckets
- IAM user
- Resource policies
---
# Problem Effects
Developers:
- spent over and over again the time to create the same or similar policies
- Many team members have to re-do this :point_up:
- In-experienced or developers having forgotten, have to spent slow thinking to
    find out or remember what policies are required.
- Due to the silo, no opportunity to review or create conventions
---
# Solution
Use terraform to automate the management of the resources required for CI/C
---
# Additional Value
- Re-usable templates. E.g. aws-sam template, sqs template, sns template
- Invest in re-usable long term knolwedge
- Any developer regardless of their terraform or aws knowledge can create PR
- More knowledge sharing & transparency of policies
---
# Workflow
- Copy an existing terraform file setup
- Modify the policy action templates accordingly
- Create PR
---
# Next
Ordered by priority
1. On next new serverless repo, use this workflow to start automating CI/CD resources.
2. When working with a existing serverless repo
   - which requires policies change, use that opportunity to automate the CI/CD resources.
   - which requires code change, use that opportunity to automate the CI/CD resources.
